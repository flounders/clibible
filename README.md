clibible
========

clibible is a Command Line Interface to the Bible using the Sword library
and modules.

## Install

You will need the Sword and Standard C++ libraries installed to compile.

Otherwise just run CMake. If you are using a Unix based system then run
make, and that is all you need. If you are using another platform you
will need to see what you need to do with the generated CMake output.
